**1. Python Problem**<br/>
You have to write a python script which can fetch all the tweets(as many as allowed by Twitter
API) done by midas@IIITD twitter handle and dump the responses into JSONlines file.
The other part of your script should be able to parse these JSONline files to display the
following for every tweet in a tabular format.

● The text of the tweet.<br/>
● Date and time of the tweet.<br/>
● The number of favorites/likes.<br/>
● The number of retweets.<br/>
● Number of Images present in Tweet. If no image returns None.


**2. Computer Vision Problem**<br/>
You can download train and test dataset from here [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F2PjpJ_u_iaD-Fs0wwcymRiVVLK34-Fu]. This dataset has 4 classes. Labels for
training data are provided, you have to submit labels of test data. Feel free to use any Machine
learning or Deep learning technique.
Submission
In the form, you would have to submit the CSV file<br/>

***Tried with 3 hidden layers, but it performs better with 1 or 2 hidden layers within it. That's why the other hidden layers are commented out.***
