**Python Problem**<br/>
You have to write a python script which can fetch all the tweets(as many as allowed by Twitter
API) done by midas@IIITD twitter handle and dump the responses into JSONlines file.
The other part of your script should be able to parse these JSONline files to display the
following for every tweet in a tabular format.

● The text of the tweet.<br/>
● Date and time of the tweet.<br/>
● The number of favorites/likes.<br/>
● The number of retweets.<br/>
● Number of Images present in Tweet. If no image returns None.
